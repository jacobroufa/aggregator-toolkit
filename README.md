# Documenters Aggregator Toolkit

The Documenters Program is one of three City Bureau programs designed to engage the public in meaningful, informed discussions around critical issues through journalism and civic engagement.

The Documenters Aggregator a collection of scrapers and utilities to collect and store a comprehensive, central, and accessible calendar for public government meetings in Chicago and Cook County.

The Aggregator Toolkit is a toolkit for setting up public meetings aggregators in cities, states and municipalities.

This project is designed to aid [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/)'s [Documenters](http://www.citybureau.org/documenters/) program in identifying public meetings, assigning people to document them, and capturing notes and information about the meetings.

Documenters Aggregator is a community-based open source project with a friendly community that welcomes contributions from everyone.
